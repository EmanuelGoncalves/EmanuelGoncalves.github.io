My research activities fall in the broad areas of Cancer Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Machine Learning.
<br>
<br>
I develop computational methods to efficiently model the complexity of large-scale molecular biology datasets (genomics, proteomics and metabolomics), and integrate with functional genomics (CRISPR) and pharmacogenomics to enquire regulatory mechanisms important in cancer. 
<br>
<br>
These methods provide data-driven hypotheses to guide the interpretation of biological phenomena and propose novel clinically relevant biomarkers.
