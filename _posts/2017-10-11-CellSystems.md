We built an efficient genome-wide association pipeline to test thousands of potential associations between genomics and proteomics datasets from cancer patients.
<br>
<br>
This revealed that copy-number changes are frequently post-transcriptionally attenuated at the protein level and particularly noticeable in protein complexes where copy-number alterations are buffered by co-regulation of subunits abundance. This study showed the broad implications of post-transcriptional regulation in cancer and, despite their high frequency, 23%-33% of the observed copy-number alterations are buffered.

[More recently](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA118.001280), we reported the importance of protein interfaces to regulate these interactions.
