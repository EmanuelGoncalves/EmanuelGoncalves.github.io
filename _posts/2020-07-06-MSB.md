The [Sanger](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) (UK) and [Broad](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) (USA) Institutes joined efforts to generate a complete map of all cancer vulnerabilities to propose novel therapeutical targets ([Cancer Dependency Map](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00182-0)).
<br>
<br>
Harnessing the Cancer DepMap CRISPR-Cas9 and drug sensitivity screens across 484 cancer cell lines, we created a computational resource for 397 anti-cancer drugs that informs on many aspects of drug mode-of-action (i.e. in cellular activity, isoform specificity and potential polypharmacology effects).
<br>
<br>
The millions of associations tested allowed us to characterise protein networks underlying drug response and revealed novel regulatory interactions.
