I'm a Senior Data Scientist at precision medicine start-up Ophiomics, Lisbon – Portugal, leading research and development of novel diagnostic and prognostic products for liver cancer patients using machine learning approaches.

I'm also a Visiting Researcher at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge – UK, where I, as a Postdoctoral Researcher, took part and lead international and multidisciplinary projects bridging machine learning with genomic and functional genomic assays, such as CRISPR-Cas9, and proteomics to characterise genetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells and put forward novel clinically actionable biomarkers for precision medicine.

I graduated in Informatics Engineering (2010) from the University of Minho, where I also completed a Master’s in Bioinformatics (2012), awarded with distinction, with thesis carried-out at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge - UK. I obtained my PhD in Systems Biology from the University of Cambridge (2017) with work carried at EMBL-EBI.
